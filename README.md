# Voting-Classifier-Hybrid-Ensemble
A Voting classifier model combines multiple different models (i.e., sub-estimators) into a single model, which is (ideally) stronger than any of the individual models alone. It is a type of Hybrid Ensemble technique.

The idea behind the voting classifier is to combine conceptually different machine learning classifiers and use a majority vote (hard vote) or the average predicted probabilities (soft vote) to predict the class labels. Such a classifier can be useful for a set of equally well performing model in order to balance out their individual weaknesses.
